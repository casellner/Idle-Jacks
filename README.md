# Idle-Jacks
![prettier version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3-brightgreen)
This repo is an open-source idle game inspired by knucklebones. My primary goal with this project is to dip my toes back into game development after a short hiatus.

## Roadmap

1. Review and refactor code
2. v0.4 Upgrades System
3. BGM and revamped sounds
4. Other graphics tweaks
5. Make game look better on itch.io
6. Final tweaks and release v1.0!
