# Idle-Jacks
![prettier version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3-brightgreen)
This repo is an open-source idle game inspired by knucklebones. My primary goal with this project is to dip my toes back into game development after a short hiatus.

## Roadmap
- v0.4 Upgrades System
- v0.5 BGM and sounds rework
- v0.6 ball color picker
- v1.0 Prestige and potential sendoff
