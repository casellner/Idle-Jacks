# Idle-Jacks
![prettier version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2-brightgreen)
This repo is an open-source idle game inspired by knucklebones. My primary goal with this project is to dip my toes back into game development after a short hiatus.

## Roadmap
- v0.3 Second Small Graphics Update
   - Add detailed background
   - Revamp sprites
   - Polish anything else so nice screenshots can be taken
- Change itch.io page theme
- v0.4 Upgrades System
