# Idle-Jacks
![prettier version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.4-brightgreen)
This repo is an open-source idle game inspired by knucklebones. My primary goal with this project is to dip my toes back into game development after a short hiatus.

## Roadmap

1. v0.5 BGM and revamped sounds
2. v0.6 Other graphics tweaks
3. Make game look better on itch.io
4. Final tweaks and release v1.0!
